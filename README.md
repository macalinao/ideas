ideas
=====

Random ideas or things that I can work on when I'm bored.

## Useful
* A Yeoman generator for Angular that scaffolds a working route like `rails scaffold`. Should use Preston.
* Ebay sniper that you give a budget (say, $20/month) and it will randomly buy crap and mail it to you
* --Notifier thing that is Yo but solely for notifications-- pennapps
* Similar music finder based on chord progression, amount of bass, etc. Each song will have some kind of fingerprint that can be compared with other songs.
* Similar music finder based on what others listened to -- requires a data source
* Dash clone that uses Dox
* hacker.json - A subset of JSON resume built for creating a hacker directory. Checks GitHub, a personal website, and a directory for presence of this hacker.json file.
* rendezvous -- an app that lets you see where other people are before meeting
* AutoDJ -- automatically mix songs
* Something where you can order to-go on your phone and pay on it as well
* A theremin-like instrument using galileo that is easy to learn.

### Probably can't do
* Javascript DAW/Social Network
* Rewrite Bloopsaphone for Node
* Altcoin trading bot -- probably not worth the returns I'll get

## Useless
* sakit.io - Something that tells you if you're sick, in real time!
* A timer countdown webpage to use in hackathons or something

## Knowledge
* Learn Clojure or some kind of functional language
* Write all of the algorithms and data structures possible and turn them into 1000 unmaintained NPM packages
* Learn Rails
* Buy a Mac/Intel and learn iOS!!!
* Learn Docker
