ideas
=====

Random ideas or things that I can work on when I'm bored.

## Useful
* A Yeoman generator for Angular that scaffolds a working route like `rails scaffold`. Should use Preston.
* Ebay sniper that you give a budget (say, $20/month) and it will randomly buy crap and mail it to you
* Notifier thing that is Yo but solely for notifications

### Probably can't do
* Javascript DAW/Social Network
* Rewrite Bloopsaphone for Node
* Altcoin trading bot -- probably not worth the returns I'll get

## Useless
* sakit.io - Something that tells you if you're sick, in real time!
* A timer countdown webpage to use in hackathons or something

## Knowledge
* Learn Clojure or some kind of functional language
* Write all of the algorithms and data structures possible and turn them into 1000 unmaintained NPM packages
* Learn Rails
* Buy a Mac/Intel and learn iOS!!!
* Learn Docker
